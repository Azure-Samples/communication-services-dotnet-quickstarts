# Recording APIs Sample

This is a sample application to showcase how the Call Automation SDK can be used to add recording features to any application.
This application, built on the .NET Core framework using C#, is seamlessly integrated with Azure Communication Services. It harnesses the power of Azure Communication Services to establish connections and enable communication features within the application.
A separate branch with end to end implementation is [available](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-calling-hero/tree/public-preview). It's a public preview branch and uses beta SDKs that are not meant for production use. Please use the main branch sample for any production scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Visual Studio (2022 and above)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [.NET7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) (Make sure to install version that corresponds with your visual studio instance, 32 vs 64 bit)
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You'll need to record your Communication Service resource **Connection string** under Keys section for this sample.
- Enable Visual studio dev tunneling for local development. For details, see   [Enable dev tunnel] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/port-tunneling)
	
	- To enable dev tunneling, Click `Tools` -> `Options` in Visual Studio 2022.  In the search bar type tunnel, Click the checkbox under `Environment` -> `Preview Features` called `Enable dev tunnels for Web Application`
	![EnableDevTunnel](./data/EnableDevTunnel.png) 
	- Create `Dev Tunnels` by followingg this link -> [Dev Tunnels.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/dev-tunnels?view=aspnetcore-7.0)  
	**Note:** For accessing the Dev Tunnel Url publicly change the Access to Public.  


## Clone the code local and update appsettings

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Communication-Services-dotnet-quickstarts.git`
3. Once you get the code on local machine, navigate to **CallRecording/appsettings.json** file found under the CallRecording folder.
4. Update the values for below.

	| Key | Value | Description |
	| -------- | -------- | -------- |
	| `ACSResourceConnectionString`    | \<ACS Connection String>   | Input your ACS connection string in the variable   |
	| `ACSAcquiredPhoneNumber`    | \<ACS Acquired Number>   | Phone number associated with the Azure Communication Service resource   |
	| `BaseUri`    | \<dev tunnel url>   | Base url of the app, don't add `/` at end. For getting the dev tunnel url, run the app once.   |

## Locally Run the sample app

1. Go to CallRecording folder and open `RecordingApi.csproj` solution in Visual Studio.
2. Enable Visual Studio Dev Tunnels for local development (see pre-requisite section for enabling dev tunnel).
3. Run the application in debug mode, swagger url should open, if swagger not opened by itself add `/swagger/index.html` at the end.

## Create Webhook for Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatus event
Call Recording enables you to record multiple calling scenarios available in Azure Communication Services by providing you with a set of APIs to start, stop, pause and resume recording. To learn more about it, see [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/call-recording). 
1. Navigate to your Communication Service resource on Azure portal and select `Events` from the left side blade.
2. Click `+ Event Subscription` to create a new subscription, provide `Name` field value. 
3. Under Topic details, choose a System Topic or create new, no changes required if its already have topic name.  
4. Under `Event Types` Filter for `Recording File Status Updated` event. 
5. Choose `Endpoint Type` as `Web Hook` and provide the public url generated by Dev Tunnels. It would look like `https://21pdf6lm-44348.usw2.devtunnels.ms/recordingFileStatus`.  
6. Click `Create` to complete the event grid subscription. The subscription is ready when the provisioning status is marked as succeeded.  
**Note:** Application should be running to able to create the `Web Hook` successfully. 


# Step by step guid for testing recording APIs via swagger.

Once App is running local, you will see all list of exposed API on swagger.
1. Step 1. Start a call invoke OutboundCall under Outbound section.
	- Try it out `GET OutboundCall`, provide the Target PSTN phone number to get the call.
	- `Execute`, accept the call on Target PSTN Phone number, Keep call running.
2. Step 2. Start Recording.
	-	Try it out `GET StartRecording`, provide the serverCallId value, optional if recording the same call started in step1.
	- 	`Execute`, recording would be started.
3. Step 3. (Optional) Execute `POST PauseRecording` and then `POST ResumeRecording`, passing recordingId is optional.
4. Step 4. Execute `DELETE StopReocording` for stop the recording.
5. Step 5. Execute `GET DownloadRecording` for downloading the recording from server, only last recorded file will be downloaded.
6. Step 6. Execute `DELETE DeleteRecording` for delete the recording at server.


## Troubleshooting

1. Solution doesn\'t build, it throws errors during build.
	- Clean/rebuild the C# solution.
2. Recording files not getting downloaded.
	- Check for webhook settings if dev tunnel url is correct.
3. Recording files not getting downloaded.
      	- Check EventGrid under ACS Resource if this is correctly configured.
