# Outbound Reminder Call Sample

This sample application shows how the Azure Communication Services Server Calling SDK can be used to build IVR related solutions. This sample makes an outbound call to a phone number or a communication identifier and plays an audio message. If the callee presses 1 (tone1), to reschedule an appointment, then the application invites a new participant and then leaves the call. If the callee presses any other key then the application ends the call. This sample application is also capable of making multiple concurrent outbound calls.
The application is a console based application built on .Net Framework 4.7.2.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Visual Studio (2019 and above)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) (Make sure to install version that corresponds with your visual studio instance, 32 vs 64 bit)
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You'll need to record your resource **connection string** for this sample.
- Get a phone number for your new Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Get a phone number](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/get-phone-number?pivots=platform-azp)
- Download and install [Ngrok](https://www.ngrok.com/download). As the sample is run locally, Ngrok will enable the receiving of all the events.
- (Optional) Create Azure Speech resource for generating custom message to be played by application. Follow [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/overview#try-the-speech-service-for-free) to create the resource.

> Note: the samples make use of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license201809).

## Before running the sample for the first time

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Communication-Services-dotnet-quickstarts.git.
